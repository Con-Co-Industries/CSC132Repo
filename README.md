# CSC132Repo

This is a repo for my CSC 132 Files. All folders and files will most likely have '132' before or after them. This can be disregarded, it is just to help me keep track on my physical computer.  
There are five folders in this repo:
1. The Final Pi Project
2. Notes
3. Pi Activities
4. Python Assignments
5. Misc

## The Final Pi Project Folder

The Final Pi Project folder is pretty self explanitory. It contains any and all files related to the Final Pi Project for Computer Science.  
As of right now, our group had an idea of using a pi to, like, run a video through or something, but we're not 100% set on the idea yet, and haven't started coding.

## The Notes Folder

The Notes folder contains all of the notes I've taken across the class. They are split up into 7 sections:
1. More On Objects
2. More On Data Structures
3. Building A Computer
4. Problem Solving With Computers
5. Software Engineering
6. Algorithms Reloaded
7. Git For Beginners  

> Note: Git For Beginners is labeled as number 8. I can't remember why this is, but I swear there's a good reason

### More On Objects

- The first file in the folder, 1.1 Review.py, is a review file wherein there are Vehicle classes that use multiple inheritence. The file has more info on the specifics of the classes.  
- The second file, 1.2 Abstraction and Modularization.txt, is a text file that defines the concepts of Abstraction and Modularization.  
- The third file, 1.3 Method Lookup.py, breifly describes polymorphism and method lookup, and gives examples.

### More On Data Structures

- The first file in the folder, 2.1 Sets and Dictionaries.py, describes what sets and dictionaries are in python, as well as gives a few examples.  
- The second file, Filter Map Reduce.py, breifly describes what the Filter function, Map function, and Reduce functions do in python and give examples.  

> Note: The Letters folder is just where Filter Map Reduce.py writes letters too, the program explains more in detail.   

- The third file, Comprehensions.py, gives some examples of List Comprehension in python.

### Building A Computer

This folder is currently empty, it will be filled in if/when we cover those notes in class.

### Problem Solving With Computers

This folder is currently empty, it will be filled in if/when we cover those notes in class.

### Software Engineering

This folder is currently empty, it will be filled in if/when we cover those notes in class.

### Algorithms Reloaded

This folder is currently empty, it will be filled in if/when we cover those notes in class.

### Git For Beginners

This folder is currently empty, it will be filled in if/when we cover those notes in class.

## Pi Activities

The Pi Activites folder contains all files related to the class Pi Activites, not including the final group pi project. There are two pi activites this quarter:
1. Pi Adventure Revolutions
2. Paper Piano  

Currently, we have not done anything with the Pi Activites and the folder is empty, so they will not be given sections here. The README will be updated if/when we start working on them and they get files added to them.

## Python Assignments

As well as Pi Activites, we are also given general Python Assignments to complete. The Python Assignments folder contains all files related to those assignments. We are given 5 Assignments throughout the class:
1. 2D Points
2. 2D Points... Plotted
3. The Chaos Game
4. Shapes
5. Chaos Game Reloaded

> Note: Assignments 3, 4, & 5 currently haven't been assigned and thus have no info and are empty. These will be updated when the assignments are, well, assigned.

For the description of each class, I will be directly quoting from the assignment page on [Louisiana Tech's Moodle](https://moodle.latech.edu/course/view.php?id=89826). __All assignments and templates are property of Louisiana Tech University; I do not take credit for creating them.__

### 2D Points

In this assignment, we have to create a 2D Point class. The requirements for this assignment are in this document: [2D Points.pdf](https://github.com/Con-Co-Industries/CSC132Repo/files/8274205/2D.Points.pdf)  
__All assignments and templates are property of Louisiana Tech University; I do not take credit for creating them.__

### 2D Points... Plotted

2D Points... Plotted is kind of a continuation of assignment 1. In this assignment, we have to implement a coordinate system class using the Tkinter Python library that will enable plotting points graphically. The requirements for this assignment are in this document: [2D Points...Plotted.pdf](https://github.com/Con-Co-Industries/CSC132Repo/files/8274198/2D.Points.Plotted.pdf)

## The Misc Folder

Relatively self explanitory, contains any files that don't fit into any of the prior folders. It is incredibly likely that this folder will be empty.
